\arguments{
\item{clim.signal}{The "assumed true" climate signal, e.g. climate model
output or instrumental record. A \code{\link{ts}} object consisting of a
years x 12 (months) x n habitats (e.g. depths) matrix of temperatures. The
time series should be at annual resolution and in reverse, i.e. "most
recent timepoint first" order.}

\item{timepoints}{The timepoints for which the proxy record is to be modelled}

\item{calibration.type}{Type of proxy, e.g. Uk'37 or MgCa, to which the
clim.signal is converted before the archiving and measurement of the proxy
is simulated. Defaults to "identity" which means no conversion takes place.}

\item{calibration}{The name of a specific calibration for which calibration parameters
are provided by sedproxy. Currently applies only to calibration.type MgCa.}

\item{slp.int.means}{Optional user supplied vector of values for the slope
and intercept of the calibration function. Overides the defaults.}

\item{slp.int.vcov}{Optional user supplied variance covariance matrix
calibration parameters. Overides the defaults.}

\item{noise.type}{Determines whether additive or multiplicative measurement
noise is added. The appropriate type depends on the units of the proxy.
Defaults to multiplicative for MgCa, additive for Uk'37 and identity (none)
calibration types. Can be overidden with a string, "additive" or
"multiplicative" in the case that pre-converted climate signal and
measurement noise values are used in combination with an "identity"
calibration type.}

\item{plot.sig.res}{The resolution, in years, of the smoothed (block
averaged) version of the input climate signal returned for plotting. This
does not affect what the proxy model uses as input. If set to NA, no
smoothed climate output is generated, this can speed up some simulations.}

\item{habitat.weights}{Production weights for the proxy / proxy-carrier
either as a vector of values with length = ncol(clim.signal), i.e. 1 weight
for each month x habitat combination, a matrix of the same dimensions as the
input climate signal matrix, or a function that produces an index of
productivity as a function of temperature.
Defaults to a vector of length = ncol(clim.signal) of equal weights.}

\item{habitat.wt.args}{A named list of parameter values to be passed to
a function named in habitat.weights.}

\item{bio.depth}{Depth of the bioturbated layer in cm, defaults to 10 cm.}

\item{sed.acc.rate}{Sediment accumulation rate in cm per 1000 years. Defaults
to 50 cm per ka. Either a single value, or vector of same length as
"timepoints"}

\item{layer.width}{the width of the sediment layer from which samples were
taken, e.g. foraminifera were picked or alkenones were extracted, in cm.
Defaults to 1 cm. If bio.depth and layer.width are both set to zero,
each timepoint samples from a single year of the clim.signal, equivalent to
sampling an annually laminated sediment core.}

\item{sigma.meas}{The standard deviation of the measurement error
added to each simulated proxy value.}

\item{sigma.ind}{The standard deviation of error between individuals
(e.g. Forams) not otherwise modelled. This could included "vital effects" or
aliasing of depth habitat variation not modelled via a depth resolved input
climate signal and habitat weights. sigma.ind is scaled by n.samples
before being combined with sigma.meas.}

\item{meas.bias}{The amount of bias to add to each simulated proxy
time-series. Each replicate proxy time-series has a constant bias added,
drawn from a normal distribution with mean = 0, sd = meas.bias. Bias
defaults to zero.}

\item{scale.noise}{Scale noise to proxy units. Defaults to TRUE if
calibration.type is not "identity"}

\item{n.samples}{Number of e.g. Foraminifera sampled per timepoint, this can
be either a single number, or a vector of length = timepoints. Can be set
to Inf for non-discrete proxies, e.g. for Ukâ€™37.}

\item{n.replicates}{Number of replicate proxy time-series to simulate from
the climate signal}

\item{top.of.core}{The theoretical minimum age at the top of the core, ie.
the year the core was sampled, defaults to the start of clim.in}

\item{n.bd}{Number of multiples of the bioturbation width at which to truncate
the bioturbation filter}
}
\value{
\code{ClimToProxyClim} returns an object of class "sedproxy.pfm", a list with three elements:
\enumerate{
\item a dataframe \code{simulated.proxy}
\item a dataframe \code{smoothed.signal}
\item a dataframe \code{everything}
}

The dataframe \code{simulated.proxy} contains a single realisation of the
final forward modelled proxy, as well as the intermediate stages and the
original climate signal at the requested timepoints.

The dataframe \code{smoothed.signal} contains a block averaged version the
input climate signal, defaults to 100 year means but this is set by the
parameter plot.sig.res. This is useful for plotting against the
resulting simulated proxy.

The dataframe \code{everything} contains all of the above but with multiple
replicates of the pseudo-proxy records if requested. The data are in
"long form", with the column "stage" inidcating the proxy stage or input
climate resolution and column "value" giving the values.

\description{
\code{ClimToProxyClim} simulates the creation of a proxy climate
record from a climate signal that is assumed to be true.

The following aspects of proxy creation are currently modelled.
\enumerate{
\item Seasonal bias in the encoding of a proxy due to the interaction between
climate seasonality and any seasonality in the life cycle of the organism
encoding the climate signal (e.g. Foraminifera for Mg/Ca ratios, or
phytoplankton for Alkenone unsaturation indices).
\item Bioturbation of the sediment archived proxy. For each requested
timepoint, the simulated proxy consists of a weighted mean of the climate
signal over a time window that is determined by the sediment accumulation
rate \emph{sed.acc.rate} and the bioturbation depth \emph{bio.depth} which defaults
to 10 cm. The weights are given by the depth solution to an impulse
response function (Berger and Heath, 1968).
\item Aliasing of seasonal and inter-annual climate variation onto to
bioturbated (smoothed) signal. For proxies measured on a small number of
discrete particles both seasonal and inter-annual climate variation is
aliased into the proxy record. For example, Foraminifera have a life-cycle
of approximately 1 month, so they record something like the mean
temperature from a single month. If Mg/Ca is measured on e.g.
\code{n.samples} = 30 individuals, the measured proxy signal is a mean of
30 distinct monthly mean temperatures and will thus be a stochastic sample
of the true mean climate.
\item Measurement noise/error is added as a pure Gaussian white noise process
with mean = 0, standard deviation =
\code{sqrt(sigma.meas^2 + sigma.ind^2/n.samples)}.
\item Additionally, a random \emph{bias} can be added to each realisation of a
proxy record. Bias is simulated as a Gaussian random variable with mean =
0, standard deviation = \code{meas.bias}. The same randomly generated bias
value is applied to all timepoints in a simulated proxy record, when
multiple replicate proxies are generated (\emph{n.replicates} > 1) each
replicate has a different bias applied.
}

\code{ClimToProxyClim} returns one or more replicates of the final
simulated proxy as well as several intermediate stages (see section
\strong{Value} below).
