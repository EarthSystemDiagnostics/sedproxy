\title{Calibration Uncertainty}
\usage{
CalibrationUncertainty(temperature, means, vcov)
}
\arguments{
\item{temperature}{Temperature at which to evaluate proxy uncertainty in
degrees celsius}

\item{means}{slope and intercept of fitted calibration regression}

\item{vcov}{variance-covariance matrix of slope and intercept from fitted
calibration regression}
}
\value{
a tibble (dataframe) with temperature, mean proxy unit and 1 x sigma
  proxy unit
}
\description{
Calculates the calibration uncertainty at a given temperature
  from the variance-covariance matrix of the coefficients of a fitted
  calibration regression equation. Also returns the mean proxy value at the
  given temperature.

  The uncertainty in proxy units can be scaled to temperature units by
  dividing by the calibration slope.

  For linear calibrations on transformed variabes such as Mg/Ca, this is the
  uncertainty on the log(Mg/Ca) values.
