Function argument;Description;Possible sources;Default
clim.signal;Input climate signal from which a pseudo-proxy will be forward modelled.;Climate model, instrumental record.;
timepoints;Timepoints at which to generate pseudo-proxy values.;Arbitrary, or to match an existing proxy record.;
proxy.calibration.type;Type of proxy, e.g. Uk'37 or Mg/Ca, to which the input climate signal is converted prior to simulating the bioturbation and proxy sampling.;;identity
proxy.prod.weights;Proxy production weights provide information on seasonal and habitat (e.g. depth) differences in the amount of proxy material produced. This allows seasonal and habitat biases in the recorded climate to be modelled. ;"Sediment trap data or PLAFOM for foraminifera; Uitz et al. (2010) for Haptophytes";equal for all
bio.depth;Bioturbation depth in cm, the depth down to which the sediment is mixed by burrowing organisms.;Measured at sediment core or global distribution from Teal et al. (2010).;10
sed.acc.rate;Sediment accumulation rate in cm ka^-1^.;Sediment core age model.;50
layer.width;Width of the sediment layer in cm from which samples were taken, e.g. foraminifera were picked or alkenones were extracted.;core sampling protocol;1
meas.noise;Standard deviation of white noise added to each pseudo-proxy value.;;0
meas.bias;Each replicate proxy time-series has a constant bias added drawn from a normal distribution with mean = 0, sd = meas.bias.;;0
n.samples;No. of e.g. foraminifera sampled per timepoint. A single number or a vector with one value for each timepoint.;;30
n.replicates;Number of replicate pseudo-proxy time-series to simulate from the climate signal.;;
smoothed.signal.res;The resolution, in years, of the smoothed (block averaged) version of the input climate signal returned for plotting purposes. If set to NA, no smoothed climate output is generated, this can speed up some simulations.;;100
