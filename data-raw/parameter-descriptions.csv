Function argument;Description;Possible sources;Default
clim.signal;Input climate signal from which a pseudo-proxy will be forward modelled.;Climate model, instrumental record.;
timepoints;Timepoints at which to generate pseudo-proxy values.;Arbitrary, or to match an existing proxy record.;
proxy.calibration.type;"Type of proxy, e.g. Uk'37 or MgCa, to which the clim.signal is converted before the archiving and measurement of the proxy is simulated. Defaults to ""identity"" which means no conversion takes place.";;identity
habitat.weights;Habitat weights provide information on habitat (e.g. season, depth) differences in the amount of proxy material produced. This allows seasonal and habitat biases in the recorded climate to be modelled. ;"Sediment trap data, dynamic population / biogeochemical model (e.g. Fraile et al., 2008; Uitz et al., 2010), or temperature dependent growth function (e.g. from FAME, Roche et al. 2017).";equal for all
bio.depth;Bioturbation depth in cm, the depth down to which the sediment is mixed by burrowing organisms.;Estimated from radiocarbon or from global distribution (Teal et al., 2010).;10
sed.acc.rate;Sediment accumulation rate in cm ka^-1^.;Sediment core age model.;50
layer.width;Width of the sediment layer in cm from which samples were taken, e.g. foraminifera were picked or alkenones were extracted.;Core sampling protocol.;1
n.samples;No. of e.g. foraminifera sampled per timepoint. A single number or a vector with one value for each timepoint. Can be set to Inf for non-discrete proxies, e.g. Uk'37.;Core sampling protocol.;30
sigma.measurement;Standard deviation of measurement error.;Reproducibility of measurements on real world material.;
sigma.individual;Standard deviation of individual variation.;;
meas.bias;Each replicate proxy time-series has a constant bias added drawn from a normal distribution with mean = 0, sd = meas.bias.;;0
;;;
n.replicates;Number of replicate pseudo-proxy time-series to simulate from the climate signal.;;
smoothed.signal.res;The resolution, in years, of the smoothed (block averaged) version of the input climate signal returned for plotting purposes. If set to NA, no smoothed climate output is generated, this can speed up some simulations.;;100
