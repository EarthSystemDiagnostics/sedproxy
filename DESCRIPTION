Title: Simulation of Sediment Archived Climate Proxy Records
Version: 0.7.3

Description: Proxy forward modelling for sediment archived climate proxies such 
  as Mg/Ca, d18O or Alkenones. The user provides a hypothesised "true" past climate, 
  such as output from a climate model, and details of the sedimentation rate and 
  sampling scheme of a sediment core. Sedproxy returns simulated proxy records. 
  Implements the methods described in Dolman and Laepple (2018)
